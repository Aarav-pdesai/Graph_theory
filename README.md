# Graph_theory
hello reader,
<br>
This repository contains c++ implementation for 6 specific problems pertaining to graph theory concepts:
1. Eulerian path verification and illustration[#Eulerian path finder](Eulerian_path.cpp)
2. Minimum Spanning Tree using Prim's Algorithm[#MST by prim's algo](primMST.cpp)
3. Implementing Floyd warshall's algorithm to find shortest path.[floyd-warshall](floyd_warshall.cpp)
4. Implementing graph coloring algorithm. [#graph coloring](graph_coloring.cpp)
5. algorithm to find if graph is weakly, unilaterally or strongly connected.[#graph_type](graph_type.cpp)
6. algorithm to find order of an element in the group[#order](element_order.cpp)
